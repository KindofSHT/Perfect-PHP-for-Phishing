PHP Form Handler: Securely Capture, Email, and Redirect
This PHP code snippet serves as a secure way to handle form submissions, store login details, and send an email notification. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

	•	Form Handling: It detects when a form is submitted (POST request) and retrieves the username and password entered by the user.
	•	File Storage: The code creates a text file, “login_details.txt,” to securely store the login details in the format:

Username: [username]
Password: [password]


	•	Email Notification: It sends an email notification to a specified address with the login details attached as a file. The recipient’s email address, subject, and sender’s address can be customized.
	•	Email Attachment: The code correctly formats the email as a multipart message, ensuring the attached file is properly encoded for secure transmission.
	•	Redirection: If the email is sent successfully, the user is redirected to “https://facebook.com” for further actions.
	•	Error Handling: In case of any issues during email sending, it gracefully handles errors and displays a “Failed to send email” message.

Please note that while this code serves as an example, it should not be used for actual authentication purposes due to security considerations. Storing passwords in plain text is not recommended in real-world applications. Always follow best practices for securing sensitive data.

Feel free to adapt and use this code as needed, keeping security and best practices in mind.
